# Python-ProjectsPortfolio
A portfolio of bioinformatics projects demonstrating my skills in Python programming, data analysis, and biological data processing.Code is kept private for confidentiality reasons

## Overview

Welcome to my Python Public Portfolio! This repository is a collection of my bioinformatics projects where I apply Python to solve biological data challenges. These projects demonstrate my skills in Python programming, data analysis, biological data processing, and statistical modeling. Each project focuses on different aspects of bioinformatics, including protein sequence analysis, gene data retrieval, and more.

Although the source code for these projects is kept private due to confidentiality reasons, this repository includes detailed descriptions, project highlights, the tools and programs used, and example outputs. If you're interested in viewing the code or discussing my work, please feel free to contact me.

  - Extracting and analyzing specific sequences from large biological datasets.
  - Verifying the reliability of sequence data processing pipelines using automated testing.

### 4. Gene Data Retrieval
- **Description**: This project retrieves gene descriptions and processes gene data from various sources. The focus is on automating the retrieval and processing of gene-level information for large datasets, ensuring accurate file handling and data validation.
- **Tools/Programs**: Python, `os`, `sys`, `argparse`, `re`, and potentially `pandas` for data manipulation.
- **Skills Applied**: Gene data retrieval, file handling, and data processing.
- **Example Use Cases**:
  - Automating the processing and querying of gene data for large-scale bioinformatics analysis.
  - Handling complex gene data files with validation to ensure the accuracy of results.

### 5. Gene Data Analysis
- **Description**: This project analyzes gene data by counting gene categories and finding intersections between different datasets. It identifies common genes across datasets and performs automated validation to ensure accuracy.
- **Tools/Programs**: Python, `argparse`, `os`, `csv`, `re`, and testing with `PyTest`.
- **Skills Applied**: Gene data analysis, set operations for finding intersections, automated testing for validating results.
- **Example Use Cases**:
  - Identifying overlapping genes between datasets to uncover relationships or patterns.
  - Analyzing gene categories and their occurrences across multiple datasets.
